# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using modern web development technologies. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one player wins by lining up three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until the game results in a draw.
